# C-based-shell
This is an implementation of very basic C based shell project which I tried to make using slight view of C that I have and internet articles to understand how a terminal works & learn more on how applications in C work or UNIX operate. The program has chief 3 commands i.e:
  * cd
  * help
  * exit
  
These commands are written as function into the C code to operate them, whereas to use other commands use man to check up on upon them.

Use whitespaces to run more than 1 commands.

## Requirements
C- Language

## Install
Just download the Repo,and run the C file using a g++ compiler from within your shell.
